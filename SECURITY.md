## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the issues tab, and we will be checking there at least twice a day.
We will provide information about fixed vulnerabilities in each new update, and
mark issues as resolved when we fix them.

There is a way to report bugs from the app. Just use the "Report a Bug" option.
